                    The motivation for this project came from a desire to have an impact on the healthcare industry. The clinical skills portion of the United States Medical Licensing Examination requires students to write a patient note after interacting with actors portraying specific clinical cases. Doctors would then score the patient notes based off of the important topics, using a rubric. However, scoring these exams requires time, and human and financial resources. The goal of this project is to use NLP to help automate this scoring process. My team performed exploratory data analysis on the patient notes, executed NLP techniques to locate required portions of patient notes to be graded by doctors, and incorporated machine learning and deep learning to predict case number and extract text.

                The motivation for this project came from a desire to help people understand what is in the food they eat and to what group it might belong. It uses tabular data from <a href="https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-facts-database-spreadsheet.php"><u>Food Data</u></a>. I was interested in predicting food groups and calories by how much of a vitamin, mineral, or nutrient was in the food. I believe this can help people manager their diets and avoid foods that are marketed as healthy, but actually are not. In addition, it can help a business better market their products increasing revenue. My future plan for this project is to deploy in a Flask App and join it with my Fruits, Veggies Nutrition Facts project to give people a one stop shop for all their diet and health desires.

                    The motivation for this project came from my desire to help people lead better, healthier lives. It uses image recognition to classify fruits and vegetables and displays nutrition facts for the predicted image in a flask app. Future plan for this project is to increase the database size, create a recommender system, and deploy it on AWS for the public to use. I believe that this project, seen to fruition, can help people understand what they are eating and why and hopefully motivate them to eat healthier. With regard to business acumen, I believe this can hit at the core of being a healthy person and therefore has applications in healthcare, biotech, genomics, nutrition, mental health, health and wellness, and productively in the work place.

                    The motivation for this project came from a desire to understand what makes people happy and to what degree. It uses tabular data from The Authentic Happiness Lifestyle and Wellbeing Test. I was interested to understand what demographics of people are the happiest and how much of a role certain features play. It predicts what is someone's happiness score, which can be translated into what degree. Future plan for this project is to build out the data set to have more questions (features) and more people (samples). With regard to business acumen, I believe understanding what makes people happy will lead to better mental health and therefore productivity.
