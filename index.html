                    The motivation for this project came from my desire to help people lead better, healthier lives. It uses image recognition to classify fruits and vegetables and displays nutrition facts for the predicted image in a flask app. Future plan for this project is to increase the database size, create a recommender system, and deploy it on AWS for the public to use. I believe that this project, seen to fruition, can help people understand what they are eating and why and hopefully motivate them to eat healthier. With regard to business acumen, I believe this can hit at the core of being a healthy person and therefore has applications in healthcare, biotech, genomics, nutrition, mental health, health and wellness, and productively in the work place.

                    The motivation for this project came from a desire to understand what makes people happy and to what degree. It uses tabular data from The Authentic Happiness Lifestyle and Wellbeing Test. I was interested to understand what demographics of people are the happiest and how much of a role certain features play. It predicts what is someone's happiness score, which can be translated into what degree. Future plan for this project is to build out the data set to have more questions (features) and more people (samples). With regard to business acumen, I believe understanding what makes people happy will lead to better mental health and therefore productivity.
